# SwiftUI Async/Await API Demo

## Overview

This project demonstrates the power of **SwiftUI** combined with **Swift concurrency** techniques, such as `async`/`await`, to handle API requests efficiently. It provides a clean and modern approach to managing asynchronous data fetching and updating the user interface seamlessly.

## Features

- **SwiftUI Integration**: A declarative user interface that reacts to state changes.
- **Concurrency with async/await**: Simplified and efficient API requests using modern Swift concurrency features.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error-handling mechanisms for network operations.
- **Sample API Integration**: Includes integration with GitHub's public API.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Swift
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Concurrency**: async/await, Task, and Structured Concurrency
- **Networking**: URLSession for API requests

## Prerequisites
